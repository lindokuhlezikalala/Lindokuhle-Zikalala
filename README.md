# Lindokuhle-Zikalala

I'm Lindokuhle from Soweto, Johannesburg.I've reclently graduated as a Certified Cloud Practitioner. I'm looking for an opportunity that will  allow me to upskill myself and also apply those skills in the tech industry companies or any relevant role.

I've built a static website using AWS S3 service and I also host instances.
